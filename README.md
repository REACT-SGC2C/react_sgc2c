Comparing Angular to React:
Usage of React makes for a cleaner html file. It also requires the installation of a few React-oriented Babel modules because, unlike Angular, React isn't ES6 compliant. You also need the Babel modules to support the JSX expressions that React favors. JSX allows for the creation of applications in React. In Angular, directives are used instead. React allows updates without necessitating page reloads, increasing SPA performance speed. React also allows for easier incorporation of JQuery, though at a possible cost to speed. React doesn't bother with an MVC/MVVM pattern like Angular does, preferring to use only the View pattern.
